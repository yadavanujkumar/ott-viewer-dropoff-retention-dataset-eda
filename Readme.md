# 🎬 OTT Viewer Drop-Off & Retention Risk Dataset (v1.0)

## 📌 Overview

This dataset provides **episode-level viewer behavior data** for OTT (streaming) TV series, focused on **drop-off patterns, retention risk, and engagement dynamics** across episodes and seasons.

Unlike traditional catalog datasets (genres, ratings, cast), this dataset is designed to support **realistic retention analysis**, similar to how streaming platforms study *when* and *why* viewers stop watching.

Each row represents **one episode**, enabling fine-grained analysis across seasons and episode progressions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Dataset

The dataset is built to help answer real-world OTT analytics questions such as:

* At which episode do viewers start dropping off?
* How does retention change from Season 1 to later seasons?
* Do finales improve or hurt retention?
* How do pacing, hook strength, and cognitive load affect churn?
* Which episodes are risky for late-night recommendations?

## 📊 Dataset Highlights

* **450+ unique TV shows**
* **Episode-level granularity** (one row = one episode)
* **Up to 4 seasons per show**
* **All episodes included per season**
* US-region streaming platform availability
* Suitable for ML, EDA, clustering, and time-series analysis

The dataset is intentionally large to allow meaningful modeling rather than toy examples.

## 🧠 Data Source & Methodology

* TV show metadata is collected from **TMDB (The Movie Database) API**
* Shows are sampled using TMDB’s **dynamic “Popular TV” ranking**, which reflects *current audience interest* rather than all-time popularity
* Streaming platforms are resolved using TMDB Watch Providers (**US region**)

Viewer engagement and retention signals are **synthetically generated**, but grounded in **realistic OTT viewing behavior assumptions**, such as:

* Strong hooks reduce early drop-off
* High cognitive load increases churn risk
* Mid-season fatigue affects retention
* Viewer behavior differs between early and late episodes

No real user data is included.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* Repeated `show_id` values are **expected**, as each show appears once per episode
* Retention labels are **derived from behavioral signals**, not manually assigned
* The dataset is **intentionally imbalanced**, reflecting real OTT ecosystems where most content falls into medium engagement
* Classic and newer shows may appear together depending on current popularity signals

## 💡 Suggested Use Cases

* OTT churn prediction models
* Episode-level retention analysis
* Season fatigue and finale impact studies
* Content recommendation research
* Feature importance and explainability (SHAP)
* Machine learning coursework and portfolios
